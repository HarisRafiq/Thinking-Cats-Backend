If the \"discussion\" produces a catastrophic tail risk, the LLM doesn't lose a penny or its reputation. Talk is cheap; survival is expensive.\n\n**2. Recursive Hallucination Loops (Severity: High)**\nErrors compound. In a roundtable, one agent\u2019s \"hallucination\" becomes another\u2019s \"premise.\" It\u2019s a multi-agent Ponzi scheme of misinformation.\n\n**3. Intellectual Incest (Severity: Extreme)**\nLLMs are trained on the same corpus. A roundtable of ten agents is just one parrot looking into ten mirrors. It creates a consensus of mediocrity, not truth.\n\n### The Verdict\nKnowledge is won through trial and error, not committee meetings. Real System 2 requires the risk of being dead.
